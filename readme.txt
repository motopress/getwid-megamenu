Build better navigation menus with the WordPress mega menu blocks.

== Description ==

This WordPress mega menu plugin enables you to build tailor-made site navigation menus in Gutenberg.

*Note: this WP navigation block is made for the full-site editing experiences in WordPress. Until full-site editing is available in Core, the plugin provides limited options since it can't fully integrate with the navigation menu.*

The WordPress navigation menu plugin adds a few free mega menu Gutenberg blocks for different purposes:

* Mega menu block.
* Mega menu item block.
* Plain menu block.
* Plain menu item block.

The mega menu item block is very flexible - it allows you to add drop-down menus that can handle any WordPress block, giving you full control over the look and feel of your menus.

= How you can approach the WordPress mega menu plugin: =

* The mega menu block is a container that can handle only mega menu items, which, in their turn, can handle nested drop-downs, i.e. contain any other blocks.
* Plain menu blocks can contain plain menu items that can handle drop-downs with other plain menu items.
* The width, color, font size, layouts (horizontal and vertical) of some navigation blocks are fully customizable.
* You can optionally transform a WordPress navigation menu into the "hamburger button" for mobile devices.
