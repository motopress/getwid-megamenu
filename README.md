This plugin is a fork of the [WordPress Mega Menu block](https://wordpress.org/plugins/getwid-megamenu/)
because I would like to have some upgrades and customizations.

It allows you to build simple and advanced navigation menus the WordPress way with blocks.
With this [WordPress Mega Menu block](https://wordpress.org/plugins/getwid-megamenu/), you'll be able to build and customize menus seamlessly using dedicated WP navigation blocks.

The WordPress Mega Menu block comprises several navigation blocks:

* Mega menu block
* Mega menu item block
* Plain menu block
* Plain menu item block

For advanced nav menus, use the mega menu item block. Its flexibility will let you add drop-down menus that can handle any WordPress block inside them, meaning you can show any content in your navigation menus.

A quick guide to working with the WordPress Mega Menu plugin:

* The mega menu block can host mega menu items with nested drop-downs, i.e. they can contain any Gutenberg blocks.
* Plain menu blocks can contain plain menu items with drop-downs containing other plain menu items.
* You can change the width, color, font size, layouts (horizontal/vertical) of some mega menu blocks.
* Optionally turn on the "hamburger button" for your WordPress mega menu on mobile devices for easier navigation.

Love working in Gutenberg? Download [Getwid WordPress blocks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/getwid/) - the biggest library of free blocks and templates for the block editor.
