This plugin allows you to build simple and advanced navigation menus the WordPress way with blocks.

Once the full-site editing is released in WordPress, navigation menu plugins as we know them will become redundant. With this [WordPress Mega Menu block](https://wordpress.org/plugins/getwid-megamenu/), you'll be able to build and customize menus seamlessly using dedicated WP navigation blocks.

Note: until full-site editing is not merged into WordPress Core, the options of this WordPress navigation menu plugin are temporarily limited. 

The WordPress Mega Menu block comprises several navigation blocks:

* Mega menu block
* Mega menu item block
* Plain menu block
* Plain menu item block

For advanced nav menus, use the mega menu item block. Its flexibility will let you add drop-down menus that can handle any WordPress block inside them, meaning you can show any content in your navigation menus.

A quick guide to working with the WordPress Mega Menu plugin:

* The mega menu block can host mega menu items with nested drop-downs, i.e. they can contain any Gutenberg blocks.
* Plain menu blocks can contain plain menu items with drop-downs containing other plain menu items.
* You can change the width, color, font size, layouts (horizontal/vertical) of some mega menu blocks.
* Optionally turn on the "hamburger button" for your WordPress mega menu on mobile devices for easier navigation.
